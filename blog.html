              <strong>The map()</strong>  method loops through each element in array and calls the provided function for each 
              element. This method creates a new array and doesnt change the original array. you will get return from map.
                <br>
             <strong>The Filter()</strong>  method returns all the matched value. <br>

              <strong>The Find()</strong> return the only first value which match with the data. <br>
             <strong>In ForEach</strong>  you can loop through all the array and console.log all the data inbetween that loop but you cant get any return from it.

              <strong>Local storage</strong> is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. <br>
              <strong>Session storage</strong> is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials. <br>
              <strong>Cookies</strong> are the oldest and most well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and well supported by browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to store data that is not sensitive, such as user preferences.

              In this tutorial, we are going to look at each of them in detail.

              <strong>The event loop</strong> is an architectural design pattern that allows code to run asynchronously on the javascript engines and makes it possible for code to execute blocking instructions first and when available execute asynchronous functions.

                const isExist = answers.find((ans) => ans.id === quizData[index].id);
                if (isExist) {
                  let serial = 0;
                  for (let quiz of answers) {
                    if (isExist.id === quiz.id) {
                      answers.splice(serial, 1, { ...quizData[index], givenAns });

                }
                displayAnswers(answers);
              }; </pre></code></strong>  This function takes two arguments - index which represents the index of the quiz question in quizData array, and givenAns which represents the answer given by the user.
              Then it checks if the id of the current quiz question already exists in the answers array. The find() method is used to check for this. If the id exists, it means the user has already answered this question and we need to update the answer.
              after that If the id exists, the function iterates through the answers array to find the question with the same id. When it finds it, the function replaces the answer with the new answer provided by the user using the splice() method.
              If the id doesn't exist, it means this is the first time the user is answering this question. The function creates a new object with the question and the answer and pushes it to the answers array using the push() method.
              Finally, the displayAnswers() function is called with the updated answers array to update the UI and show the answers to the user.
